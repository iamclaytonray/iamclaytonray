    <p>This is a group of software projects to help facilitate creating and maintaining GraphQL APIs. The web-based GUI allows users to quickly prototype an API, especially if they are not comfortable with a terminal.</p>
    <p>Essentially, the CLI and code generation library are there to help maintain GraphQL codebases by generating relevant input types, object types, enums, interfaces, and so on. Developers can hook into a custom GraphQL directives, exposed as a public API, to generate code more efficiently and reliably, as well as having the flexibility to customize what is generated. (As opposed to just having basic CRUD operations, which is not always what is needed.)</p>
